**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

The simplest approach to determining the needs of a user is to speak with them to understand what they want to be able to do with it. User stories provide a simple framework in the 
form of "As a [user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [do something]" which helps developers conceptualize how the desires of the user can be accomplished in a technical sense. 
User stories help stakeholders and developers stay on the same page, and help to prioritize tasks based on impact.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

Breaking larger projects down into manageable pieces and using a structured approach is how I want to approach development. Before you can solve a problem, you must first seek to understand the problem as well as you can. Once I understand the problem, only then can I understand the requirements that are needed to complete the project and design a solution. Incremental development and thorough testing will ensure a quality product for the end user, and user stories will help me understand what the end-user needs to be able to do when it's finished. I also want to lead by example with staying very self-accountable for my work through being honest about the work I'm doing and where I'm running into issues.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

A good team member is someone who communicates openly and honestly, contributes their fair share of work, documents things appropriately for those who come behind them, stays up-to-date on industry best practices, and makes an effort to treat people with kindness, empathy, and respect. At the end of the day, the most important thing is to be a team player that other people actually want to work with.
